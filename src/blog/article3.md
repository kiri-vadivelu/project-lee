All sites on Netlify are prebuilt for performance and deployed directly to global edge network —without requiring to manage, scale, or patch any web servers. This enables a revolutionary new architecture called the Jamstack, designed to make the web faster—and to support the new tools and workflows used in modern web development. Netlify, a new approach to faster, more secure websites.

## The problem with the legacy web

### Complex apps and complex servers

A traditional website is actually a program that has to run on a web server at all times. Running sites this way needlessly slows things down, provides way too many opportunities for attack, and is expensive to scale.

### Prebuilding all pages for speed

The Jamstack doesn’t change the technologies you use—Jamstack sites can be built in JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python or virtually any language. It’s not a collection of specific software, it’s a set of best practices that combines:

### Git Workflows

The Jamstack ties deployments closely to a Git-based workflows. Git brings the rigor and safety of version control to web projects allowing support for large projects with numerous contributors.

### Modern build tools

With a build run every time a deploy happens, The Jamstack brings full support for linting code, transpiling javascript, compiling CSS, and optimizing html and assets.

### CDN Technology

First deployed by large enterprises, the Jamstack democratizes the use of CDN technology to deliver web content from end points as close to users as possible.

### What’s the catch?

Modern web development requires modern tools and infrastructure. Wiring this stuff together on your own can be challenging, even when using cloud services like AWS. (Some tutorials run 13-15 steps for setup alone! Really.) At Netlify, it is possible to build and deploy production Jamstack sites in seconds.

Netlify is the first infrastructure provider native to the Jamstack and designed to support modern tools and workflows. Learn more at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/).
