## How Netlify Forms work?

So simple to setup, it almost appears to be magic.

Just add the ` netlify ` attribute to any form and everything gets wired up automatically. Our bots find your forms by inspecting the HTML of your site before its published.

### Features that take forms further

Get notifications, trigger actions, and filter spam. Yup, again it’s all automatic.

### Be notified of every new submission

As the submissions roll in, Netlify can provide notification via email, Slack, or webhooks.

### View & Manage Responses

Netlify carefully collects every form submission in your dashboard where you can view, manage, and export the data.

### Integrate with hundreds of services

Using our Zapier integration, you can connect Netlify Forms to over 1,000 other applications. Create Zendesk tickets, add Mailchimp subscribers, or add submissions to a Google spreadsheet. The possibilities are endless.

### Spam filtering is built in

Remove the clutter of junk submissions with built-in spam filtering from Akismet.

### JavaScript not required (but well supported)

While JavaScript is never required for Netlify Forms, you can use JavaScript to submit forms with AJAX/XHR if you’d like. That makes Netlify Forms a great companion to sites powered by Vue, React, or other modern frameworks.
