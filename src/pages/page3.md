We provide you with a 7 day window from the date of website migration to your hosting for error review. This does not include new website revisions, but errors that may have occurred during migration. It is your responsibility as the client to review your website during this time and point out any errors to be corrected. Any error that you find after the 7 days, will be charged our hourly rate of $50.00.

### MIGRATION OF WEBSITE

Once the project deliverables have been approved, we require full payment of your project’s remaining balance before migrating your website onto your hosting. From the time the website is completed and ready for launch, you have a maximum of 30 days to provide us with your hosting and domain information. If that information is not provided, there is a possibility that the website will be removed from our server without notice. Extensions can be provided upon written request.

### RECOMMENDED HOSTING

We recommend the following hosts (specific packages are outlined), to ensure that you have a smooth migration experience and ensure no additional billable time. As the client, you are responsible for the management and maintenance of your hosting and domain at all times.
