      <title>Headless CMS Integration with Jamstack Applications</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/headless-cms-integration-with-jamstack-applications/</link>
      <description>
A headless CMS is a content management system that is decoupled from the work of returning and managing the views and page templates to the site&#39;s visitors. Unlike a traditional or ‘coupled’ architecture (where the backend is deeply integrated with the frontend) in a headless CMS, frontend and backend are completely separate systems.

      <title>Power of Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) Sprites on User Experience</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/power-of-scalable-vector-graphic-svg-sprites-on-user-experience/</link>
      <description>
Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) allows us to create icons in a file format that is resolution independent, which is awesome, but due to the limitations of the HTTP protocol we don&#39;t want to make another file request for every icon in our website. Thats when we combine the power of SVG with sprites.

      <title>What is the Magic of Open Source Softwares?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/what-is-the-magic-of-open-source-softwares/</link>
      <description>
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. &quot;Source code&quot; is the part of software that most computer users don&#39;t ever see; it&#39;s the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a &quot;program&quot; or &quot;application&quot;—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program&#39;s source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don&#39;t always work correctly.

      <title>Common Types of Software Licensing Models</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/common-types-of-software-licensing-models/</link>
      <description>
A license model is a combination of various parameters that define how software can be used by a customer. License models map different license attributes into logical groups, which define how a protected application is to be deployed and used. These attributes are generically defined properties (including name, data type, and possible range) making up a license.

      <title>Modern Tools for Building Jamstack Website</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/modern-tools-for-building-jamstack-website/</link>
      <description>
JAMstack applications are often built on top of client-side JavaScript, meaning you don’t need server-side languages like Ruby and Python. That doesn’t mean you can’t use them—if your application needs server-side rendering or heavy lifting, it’s just as easy to implement those tools in a JAMstack app as it is in any other. Here are some popular tools for building your website.

      <title>Understanding the Core of CSS Features</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/understanding-the-core-of-css-features/</link>
      <description>
The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that Flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. The two specifications share some common features, however, and if you have already learned how to use Flexbox, the similarities should help you get to grips with Grid.

      <title>Why Do Most Front-end Developers Love Google Fonts?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/why-do-most-front-end-developers-love-google-fonts/</link>
      <description>
Google fonts is a collection of open source font families optimized for compatibility and owned by Google. Google fonts offer a wide selection of fonts that you can use within your website and you don’t need to host them locally. Most themes nowadays actually do have the fonts integrated into them. You can also use a plugin that integrates Google fonts, to add the fonts to your website. In these scenarios, your website will request the fonts from a Google server.

      <title>Optimize Images for Web and Performance</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/optimize-images-for-web-and-performance/</link>
      <description>
What Does It Mean to Optimize Images? Large images slow down your web pages which creates a less than optimal user experience. Optimizing images is the process of decreasing their file size, using either a plugin or script, which in turn speeds up the load time of the page. Lossy and lossless compression are two methods commonly used.

      <title>What is Eleventy Static Site Generator in a Nutshell?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/what-is-eleventy-static-site-generator-in-a-nutshell/</link>
      <description>
Eleventy (also called 11ty) is a simple yet powerful static site generator. It uses JavaScript to transform data and templates into HTML pages. But first — let’s quickly review what is meant by a “static site” and then what a generator provides. A static site is composed of static content — as in, the HTML, CSS, assets, and all content are already compiled together before pushing to a website host. This is different from a dynamic site that compiles those things from querying a database at run time (like WordPress) or that pulls content from APIs client-side (like JavaScript frameworks without server-side rendering).

      <title>How to Choose between Flexbox and Grid Layout?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/how-to-choose-between-flexbox-and-grid-layout/</link>
      <description>
CSS has always been one of the most important parts of web development, we’ve been building and improving new ways to work with it since the beginning of browsers. A few years ago, creating web page layouts was a very hard job. We were using some CSS properties such as float, positioning a lot of elements with position, and inline-block styling.

      <title>What Makes Eleventy Different From Other Static Site Generators?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/what-makes-eleventy-different-from-other-static-site-generators/</link>
      <description>
Eleventy is exceptionally fast both during builds and in the browser. This is largely thanks to not requiring the loading of a client-side JavaScript bundle in order to serve content (compared to something like Gatsby). Server-side rendering isn’t even a concern here, since the filesystem page creation defaults to static HTML.

      <title>The Advantage of Modern System Fonts?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/the-advantage-of-modern-system-fonts/</link>
      <description>
A System Font is a font which is compatible with the respective operating system. What that means is that when a website loads, the font doesn’t have to downloaded by the browser. Apple created the fonts ‘San Francisco’ for desktop and ‘San Francisco Compact’ as the mobile version, announcing these at WWDC 2015. Google also created its own System Font called ‘Roboto’, which was released in 2015. Microsoft already had a default System Font called ‘Segoe UI’, which was released in 2004 – they have continued to work on it since it was launched.

      <title>Automating the Git Workflow for Continuous DevOps</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/automating-the-git-workflow-for-continuous-devops/</link>
      <description>
Automation testing is a software testing technique that uses special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. Manual testing, on the other hand, is carried out by a human sitting in front of a computer and carefully carrying out the test steps. The software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results, and generate detailed test reports. Software test automation necessitates significant financial and resource investments.

      <title>Why Should Web Developers Adapt to Variable Fonts?</title>
      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/why-should-web-developers-adapt-to-variable-fonts/</link>
      <description>
Variable fonts are an evolution of the OpenType font specification that enables many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style. They let you access all the variations contained in a given font file via CSS and a single @font-face reference. In the past, a typeface would be produced as several individual fonts, and each font would represent one specific width/weight/style combination.

      <link>https://digitaldesigners.ca/studies/preparing-for-the-future-of-core-web-technology/</link>
      <description>
Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability. Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience. It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.
